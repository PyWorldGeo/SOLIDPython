#The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and
# therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

#To state this principle more technically: Only one potential change
# (database logic, logging logic, and so on.) in the softwareâ€™s
# specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
